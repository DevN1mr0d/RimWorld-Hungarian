Also kudos to German translators. I used their DefInjected XMLs as base.

Game version: 0.15.1272

DefInjected:
Old defs converted to new format and merged with German defs. Rest of the defs added from German translation. All done.

Keyed:
Done.

Strings:
Considered done. ColonyNames not translated, maybe later. Other strings could use some love too to avoid really stupid faction names for example.
